Push all of the boxes in the level into the trapdoor opening!

To-do:
- Scoring system
- 2 last levels (for now)
- Button Styling
- Ending screen
- Saving current level to local storage
- Level menu (you can choose any of the levels you’ve already beaten)
- Music mute button/slider
- Player sprite is in front of the columns - might be annoying to fix properly
